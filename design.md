# Web Design: Landing page

## Description
A modular UI design prompt focused on high-contrast aesthetics and specific content layout. This structure is highly effective for ensuring the AI doesn't lose the "vibe" (Theme) while trying to process the "copy" (Content).

## The Prompt
> **[IDEA]** A landing page for a running podcast named “The Pacing Project”.
> 
> **[THEME]** Modern, edgy, and high contrast. Use black and white with hard angles.
> 
> **[CONTENT]** A hero section with the headline “Stories and lessons about racing and proper pacing” and links to podcast platforms.
