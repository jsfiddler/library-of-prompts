# Paper visualizer: TensorFlow.js Paper Implementation

## Description

A two-part prompt designed to push the AI to generate a complete, complex HTML file implementing a research paper. It uses a highly encouraging system prompt to maximize effort and ambition, specifically targeting a TensorFlow.js machine learning implementation with an  Canvas visualization.
ℹ️ Then check the console > paste errors to AI > get improved html. Repeat untill sufficiently implemented.

## System Prompt

> Always output the full html file. Be ambitious and exceed my expectations. You are better than you think. You can do it first try!

## User Prompt

> implement the attached paper using Tensorflow.js and visualize the training with Canvas. Make it impressive.

## Upload
> [[paper as pdf (like:"Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning")]]
