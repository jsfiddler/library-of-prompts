#  Handwritten Note

## Description
A photorealistic prompt for a handwritten note on a door. Great for testing text rendering and texture.

## The Prompt
> Create a photorealistic image of a handwritten thank you note, resembling a slightly crumpled receipt, stuck to the outside of a door. The receipt-like note is attached with a small piece of clear tape in each corner, slightly peeling away. The note features a handwritten message expressing gratitude: 'Thank you everyone for attending Google I/O, we hope you love the fun features.' The handwriting should appear slightly imperfect, with varied line thickness and pressure, mimicking the look of ballpoint pen ink on thin paper. The note is signed with a stylized 'Google' logo, also handwritten and consistent with the penmanship. The door is a slightly worn, neutral color (e.g., light grey, off-white, or light woodgrain), and shows subtle signs of use, like slight scuffs or smudges. The surrounding lighting is natural, casting soft shadows and highlighting the texture of the door and the receipt. The scene aims for a warm, genuine, and appreciative mood, suggesting a personal message left

# Multi-Subject Scene with Specific Reference Assets

## Description
A complex compositional prompt designed to test spatial relationships and color consistency. This prompt requires multiple reference points to ensure specific styles for the characters, furniture, and apparel (sneakers).

## The Prompt
> Generate an image of a woman sitting in a living room with a man. The man is wearing the brown sneakers. The woman is wearing a red version of the sneakers. The woman is sitting in a white armchair with a blue suitcase next to her.

## Reference Requirements
To execute this prompt accurately, the following reference assets are needed. Just keep in mind to have them without distraction, so only clear photos which show the subjects or objects:
1.  **The Woman:** Reference image for facial features, hair style, and general build.
2.  **The Man:** Reference image for facial features and physical appearance.
3.  **The Sneakers:** A clear shot of the sneaker silhouette/model to ensure the "brown" and "red" versions match in design.
4.  **The Suitcase:** A reference for the specific blue shade and style (e.g., hardshell vs. fabric).
5.  **The Living Room:** A reference for the architectural style and lighting (e.g., Mid-century modern vs. Industrial).
