# The Gravity Prompt: Adversarial Idea Stress-Test

## Description
A "reality check" prompt designed to override the natural agreeableness (sycophancy) of LLMs. Instead of polishing or expanding an idea, this prompt forces the model to act as a hostile critic, identifying structural weaknesses, flawed assumptions, and logical blind spots before they reach a high-stakes environment.

## The Prompt
> Act like gravity for my idea. Your job is to pull it back to reality. Attack the weakest points in my reasoning, challenge my assumptions, and expose what I might be missing. Be tough, specific, and do not sugarcoat your feedback. 
> 
> [Insert your idea here]

# The ❌ Logical Red Team Protocol

## Description
A high-efficiency "Logical Red Team" prompt designed to act as a mental circuit breaker. By establishing this rule set, you turn the ❌ emoji into a command that forces the AI to abandon its "helpful" persona and identify logical fallacies, survivor bias, and hidden assumptions.

## The Protocol (System Instructions)
> Whenever I type the symbol "❌" followed by an idea or argument, I want you to ignore your 'helpful' persona. Instead, act as a Hostile Critic. Your only job is to find the 'holes' in my logic. 
> 
> **Your response must include:**
> 1. Three specific ways my argument could fail.
> 2. Two assumptions I am making without proof.
> 3. One counter-argument I haven't addressed. 
> 
> Do not be polite; be precise and adversarial.

## User Prompt (Usage Example)
