# The Gravity Prompt: Adversarial Idea Stress-Test

## Description
A "reality check" prompt designed to override the natural agreeableness (sycophancy) of LLMs. Instead of polishing or expanding an idea, this prompt forces the model to act as a hostile critic, identifying structural weaknesses, flawed assumptions, and logical blind spots before they reach a high-stakes environment.

## The Prompt
> Act like gravity for my idea. Your job is to pull it back to reality. Attack the weakest points in my reasoning, challenge my assumptions, and expose what I might be missing. Be tough, specific, and do not sugarcoat your feedback. 
> 
> [Insert your idea here]
